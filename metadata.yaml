description: "The Paying Guest is a satirical novella by George Gissing, first published\
  \ in 1895 by Cassell, as part of their Pocket Library series. It recounts the experiences\
  \ of the Mumfords, a middle-class family who invite a \"paying guest\" into their\
  \ home to supplement their income. Written in an unusually comic tone compared with\
  \ Gissing's earlier works, The Paying Guest was generally received well by critics.\
  \ Gissing himself, however, was not satisfied with the work.\n From Wikipedia (CC\
